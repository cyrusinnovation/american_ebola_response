TOPICS:
* Locality of interest - when a country or region experiences an outbreak, interest spikes there.
* Spread of information vs spread of disease - information spreads much faster.
* Policy decisions - helping to assuage hysteria or spreading it?
* Fear as a double-edged sword, it prevents Ebola, but too much of it is a danger and threatening civil liberties
* Fear is short-lived. Illustrate with Brazil, Chile, etc. Those are very sharp spikes. Once the cause of fear has disappeared, the interest disappears as well. Contrast with Cuba.
* Ebola fatigue. Diminishing returns. Crying wolf. Previous outbreaks, it looked like this was going to be another one, interest diminished even in affected areas. Interest is diminishing again.
* Disconnect between authority figures and institutions and populace - examples in US, in Asia quote the NYTimes article, then show how this is not reflected by google search intensity.
* Show huge spikes in interest in US correlated with ebola events, no noticable difference caused by policy events.
* Lull in interest now mirrors the one immediately after the outbreak in West Africa. We found out then that things were a lot worse than we thought. Experts are saying that may be the case again and not to believe the lack of full beds.

As a psychiatrist, I do have concern about the psychological ramifications, which include frightening the public. For our emotional security, it would be best for those returning from West Africa, especially health care workers, to be quarantined, or to self-quarantine, for the appropriate length of time.
Fear of Ebola is much more contagious than the disease itself. We don't want to produce any more panic in the public.

Johnson, Steven. "Ebola’s Information Paradox." The New York Times. The New York Times, 24 Oct. 2014. Web. 02 Nov. 2014.

As societies and technologies evolve, the velocities vary with which disease and information can spread. The tremendous population density of London in the 19th century enabled the cholera bacterium to spread through a neighborhood with terrifying speed, while the information about that terror moved more slowly. This was good news for the mental well-being of England’s wider population, which was spared the anxiety of following the death count as if it were a stock ticker. But it was terrible from a public health standpoint; the epidemic had largely faded before the official institutions of public health even realized the magnitude of the outbreak.

We hear it said constantly that modern society is uniquely vulnerable to the threat of a pandemic because of the global connectedness of air travel. Yet we rarely pause to consider the other side of our global connectedness: the speed of information, which has been increasing at a much faster rate over the past few decades than the speed of airplanes has.

So this is the strange paradox of the modern epidemic: The speed of information is both our greatest defense against a true epidemic in a city like New York, and it is the source of constant, nagging anxiety that creates the — entirely incorrect — sense that we live in unusually perilous times. A New Yorker or Londoner is far less likely to perish from an epidemic disease than he or she would have been 150 years ago. We are vastly less at risk and at the same time we are more worried — for the same reason.

Information travels faster than viruses do now. This is why we are afraid. But this is also why we are safe.

"It doesn't seem like we're to that stage yet," Steven D. Gravely said, a lawyer who helped Virginia write its laws on quarantine to make it easier for the state to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. Instead, he said, "there's so much anxiety right now, that's become the problem."

"I'm very worried about it," Mr. Gostin said. "We used to think that we had balanced public health and civil liberties, but I think in this case we have forgotten that balance. And I'm one who thinks that we should always privelege public health. I'm not a civil libertarian."

Ms. Hickox raised serious concerns "about the state abusing its powers" and could spread the very fear that the order appeared aimed at counteracting.
"By forcibly detaining people, we are also frightening the public and may deter genuinely sick people who fear quarantine from seeking the treatments they deserve," Mr. Ofer said in an email.

"The challenge is good information, because information helps tell us where the disease is, how it's spreading and where we need to target our resources," Anthony Banbury told The Associated Press by phone from the Ghanaian capital of Accra, where the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, or UNMEER, is based.

"They are extremely ambitious (goals), given the geographical spread of the disease, the numbers of people infected, the very poor information on exactly where those infected are and what the transmission patterns are," Banbury said. "The three things we need the most are people, supplies and money. The most critical right now are people, health workers in particular, trained health care workers . but also people who can manage these Ebola treatment facilities."

Health care workers are finding a lot fewer ebola patients than expected in Liberia, and they don't understand why. This could be a result of fewer people with ebola, or more people hiding from health care workers.
