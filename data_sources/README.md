As a psychiatrist, I do have concern about the psychological ramifications, which include frightening the public. For our emotional security, it would be best for those returning from West Africa, especially health care workers, to be quarantined, or to self-quarantine, for the appropriate length of time.
Fear of Ebola is much more contagious than the disease itself. We don't want to produce any more panic in the public.

As societies and technologies evolve, the velocities vary with which disease and information can spread. The tremendous population density of London in the 19th century enabled the cholera bacterium to spread through a neighborhood with terrifying speed, while the information about that terror moved more slowly. This was good news for the mental well-being of England’s wider population, which was spared the anxiety of following the death count as if it were a stock ticker. But it was terrible from a public health standpoint; the epidemic had largely faded before the official institutions of public health even realized the magnitude of the outbreak.

We hear it said constantly that modern society is uniquely vulnerable to the threat of a pandemic because of the global connectedness of air travel. Yet we rarely pause to consider the other side of our global connectedness: the speed of information, which has been increasing at a much faster rate over the past few decades than the speed of airplanes has.

So this is the strange paradox of the modern epidemic: The speed of information is both our greatest defense against a true epidemic in a city like New York, and it is the source of constant, nagging anxiety that creates the — entirely incorrect — sense that we live in unusually perilous times. A New Yorker or Londoner is far less likely to perish from an epidemic disease than he or she would have been 150 years ago. We are vastly less at risk and at the same time we are more worried — for the same reason.

Information travels faster than viruses do now. This is why we are afraid. But this is also why we are safe.

"What happened in the States took us by surprised," said Louis Shih, the president of the Hong Kong Medical Association. "We were sort of feeling like, 'Oh, don't worry.' The medical sector is now quite alarmed."

"It doesn't seem like we're to that stage yet," Steven D. Gravely said, a lawyer who helped Virginia write its laws on quarantine to make it easier for the state to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. Instead, he said, "there's so much anxiety right now, that's become the problem."

"I'm very worried about it," Mr. Gostin said. "We used to think that we had balanced public health and civil liberties, but I think in this case we have forgotten that balance. And I'm one who thinks that we should always privelege public health. I'm not a civil libertarian."

Ms. Hickox raised serious concerns "about the state abusing its powers" and could spread the very fear that the order appeared aimed at counteracting.
"By forcibly detaining people, we are also frightening the public and may deter genuinely sick people who fear quarantine from seeking the treatments they deserve," Mr. Ofer said in an email.
