Data about the spread of the ebola virus were gathered from the World Health Organization Global Alert and Response and Situation Report listings. Ebola case and death numbers reported above are the combined confirmed, suspected, and probable numbers issued by the CDC.

Data about ebola searches were gathered using Google Trends. All data were normalized against the United States, with the peak US search activity for the period under study fixed at a value of 100. For an explanation of the Google Trends data, visit the about page. Search data prior to July 30th was obtained at a weekly sampling interval and interpolated. Search data on and after July 30th was sampled at a daily interval.
