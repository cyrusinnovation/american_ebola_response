			%p.quotation-contents We hear it said constantly that modern society is uniquely vulnerable to the threat of a pandemic because of the global connectedness of air travel. Yet we rarely pause to consider the other side of our global connectedness: the speed of information, which has been increasing at a much faster rate over the past few decades than the speed of airplanes has.

			%h3.section-title The Internet and the Virus
			:markdown
				The internet has turned the world upside down in a lot of different ways. It changed commerce. And kitten videos. And viruses.

				Viruses because, after all, the internet is an important avenue of distribution for most computer viruses. And further, it enables scientific research and collaboration on biological viruses at a scale not possible before. And it even gave rise to a new meaning of the word virus in its adjectival form: viral, as in, “to spread rapidly via the internet.” 

				And few things on the internet went viral in October 2014 quite like the dangerous virus ebola. But how did the ebola crisis shape the interest in itself, and how did the interest shape the ebola crisis? Unwinding the two is a vast and tangled process much like the world wide web itself.

				Below is a visualization that tracks the global spread of ebola together with the online response to it as measured by Google search activity for the term “ebola”.

			%h3.section-title Sifting the Searches
			:markdown
				Searching [Google](https://www.google.com/) can provide information about many different things. But it turns out that examining Google searches themselves can also provide some important insights. For instance, having a deep understanding of the searches on its service helps Google and [its advertisers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) [make money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdWords).

				But less cynically, Google searches can also provide information about the spread of disease, as with [Google's Flu Trends](http://www.google.org/flutrends/) service. Flu trends [works in part](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flu_Trends#Introduction) by tracking online queries for influenza-related terms in order to estimate flu activity.

				In this spirit, let's continue investigating global [Google search activity](http://www.google.com/trends/) for the term “ebola”, beginning with a look at search patterns in the United States.

				Figure **[1]** above shows that when an important ebola-related event happened in the United States, Google search activity for ebola spiked immediately or shortly thereafter (mouse over or tap on an event line to see its title).

				Spikes were more dramatic for ebola infections discovered in the United States than they were for aid workers returned to the US for treatment. Interest peaked after nurse Amber Vinson was diagnosed with Ebola on October 15th.

				Media criticisms, both foreign and domestic, of the American response to ebola have ranged from calling it a [“panic](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/10/17/stop-the-ebola-panic/)” to labelling it as “[disease-provoked hysteria](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/22/what-the-world-thinks-of-the-american-ebola-panic/)”. But is this fair? How does it compare to the response in other nations? Before investigating this further, let's get a better sense of just how intense search activity for ebola in the United States was.

			/ Many in the media have criticized the American response to ebola as one of [panic](). For the most part, the events marked on the graph above are frightening to contemplate, which would seem to corroborate fear as an important motivator in sparking the intense interest around ebola.

			%h3.section-title Comparing Activity
			:markdown
				The musician Taylor Swift released the album “[1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(Taylor_Swift_album))” in America on October 27, 2014. It is expected to sell over 1.3 million copies and [break the one-week sales record for an album by a woman](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6304336/taylor-swift-1989-biggest-sales-week-since-2002).

				Americans celebrated the popular annual holiday Halloween on October 31.

				Figure **[2]** plots search activity in the USA for the terms “Halloween”, “Taylor Swift” and “1989” against the search activity for ebola.

				Peak search activity was much higher for ebola than for Taylor Swift or her album, but only half that of Halloween.

				The nations with the consistently highest search activity for ebola are the stricken nations in West Africa – Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Figure **[3]** plots their search activity relative to that of the United States.
